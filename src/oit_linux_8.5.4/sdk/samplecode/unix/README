   How To Build Outside In Technology Sample Applications On UNIX Platforms
==============================================================================

Included in the sdk/samplecode/unix directory of all Oracle Outside In 
products that ship on UNIX platforms are a makefile and a shell script which 
facilitate the building of the various sample applications included with the
products.  The shell script generates a makefile tailored to the platform on
which the sample application(s) are being built.

**************
1 - QUICKSTART
**************
Change to the sdk/samplecode/unix directory and type

       make

This should build all the provided sample applications.  If you run into
difficulties then read on.


********************************
2 - THE _plat MAKEFILE PARAMETER
********************************
For several platforms, an extra parameter must be passed to the makefile in
order to correctly configure the platform-specific makefile to generate the
correct binary format.  The parameter is _plat, and is defined as follows
for the relevant platforms:

       ppc64 ----------- necessary to build 64-bit AIX PPC binaries
       risc64 ---------- necessary to build 64-bit HP-UX PA-RISC binaries 
       x86-64 ---------- necessary to build 64-bit SunOS x64 binaries 
       x86-32 ---------- necessary to build 32-bit SunOS x86 binaries
       sparc64 --------- necessary to build 64-bit SunOS SPARC binaries
       s390 ------------ necessary to build 31-bit zSeries Linux binaries
                         (when on a 64-bit zSeries machine ONLY)

So, for example, to build exsimple in a shell on a 64-bit HP-UX PA-RISC 
machine, type 
   
       make exsimple _plat=risc64.

For all sample applications, the binary application file is placed in a
subdirectory off of the 'unix' subdirectory that is located in the application
directory.  For example, if exsimple is built on a 32-bit SPARC SunOS 5.8 
platform, the binary will be placed in

               sdk/samplecode/exsimple/unix/SunOS5.8


*******************
3 - TROUBLESHOOTING
*******************

PROBLEM:  When I type 'make exsimple', I get the following error:

            /bin/sh: configure: cannot execute - Permission denied
            make: *** [exsimple] Error 126

SOLUTION:  Make sure the 'configure' script has execute permissions for
           either the current user, the current user's group, or the world.

---

PROBLEM:  When trying to build exsimple for 64-bit SPARC SunOS, I get the 
          following error:

            ld: fatal: file ../../demo/libsc_ex.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
            ld: fatal: file ../../demo/libsc_da.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64

SOLUTION:  Remember to set the _plat variable to sparc64.  Similar errors can 
           occur when building for other platforms that require the _plat 
           variable to be set.  See "2 - THE _plat MAKEFILE PARAMETER" above.
